# First steps in C at the university

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains my initial foray into programming in the C programming language. As a Java software developer by trade, this represents a new challenge for me, as I've primarily worked with Java in the past. I am currently learning C as part of my studies at the university, and this repository serves as a record of my progress and experiences.

## Next Steps

To further enhance my C programming skills, I plan to develop more programs and expand this repository. I welcome suggestions, improvements, and feedback from the community.
